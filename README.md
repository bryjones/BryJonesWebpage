## Welcome to my computerific webpage

This term I have learned a lot and have discovered and internal love for _computer scienc_! I am happy I took this course and was able to determine my major. :smile:

I'd like to thank our professor for teaching me some awesome things and for also clarifying my career decisions. :thumbsup:

### What I've learned this term
- How to easily create a bibliogrpahy using **Zotero** 
- Make a super fun meme using **microsoft powerpoint**
- Learn new tricks to make creating **spreadsheets** 100% easier
- How to use a fun little **Micro:bit**
- Create games, pictures, and so much more on **Python**
- And lastly how to create this super cool website on **GitHub**


### A couple _Python_ projects I am proud of

* [Triangles-and-more.zip](https://github.com/bryjones/BryJonesWebpage/files/1827986/Triangles-and-more.zip)
* [My-riddle-dungeon-game.zip](https://github.com/bryjones/BryJonesWebpage/files/1827989/My-riddle-dungeon-game.zip)
* [Set-me-free-exploration.zip](https://github.com/bryjones/BryJonesWebpage/files/1827995/Set-me-free-exploration.zip)
